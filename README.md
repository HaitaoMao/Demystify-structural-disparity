This is related code for the paper [Demystifying Structural Disparity in Graph Neural Networks: Can One Size Fit All?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01323)

- Backward contains all the codes related to the MLP-based models
- Forward contains all the codes related to the GNN-based models
- Tranfer contains all the codes for GLNN

Run the code with: python3 main_backup.py --dataset Cora --algo_name SGCNet --expmode transductive.

More update soon~
